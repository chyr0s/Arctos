# Arctos, Your New D&D Companion Bot
## Features
### Implemented
N/A (It's new still, chill!)
### To Be Implemented
#### Character Generation
- When creating a new character, Arctos will create a channel, role, and nickname for you
- For DMs, this extends to generating NPCs and their channels (but not roles or nicknames)
- Arctos also comes equipped with a new character creator to help players get off the ground quicker and into the game we all love
- Arctos will (hopefully!) provide players with a filled form fillable .pdf of their character
#### World generation
- Arctos will be able to generate settlements on the fly, and I aim to be able to incorporate [@Watabou](https://github.com/watabou/)'s various settlement generators to include maps of these settlements
#### Combat
- Arctos will help guide newer players through the steps they can take, as well as having the functionality to roll for attacks
- Arctos can help DMs by tracking enemy (and party) hitpoints
- To assist with immersion, Arctos has an optional "threat tracker" to help determine which PC enemies will target at any given moment
#### Items
- Arctos will be able to generate inventories for merchants
- Arctos will be able to generate magical items
#### Reminders
- Arctos can ping everyone as a reminder just before the session
#### Other
- Arctos will be able to automatically roll to see whether certain events happen (such as a Sorcerer's wild surge, or coming across an Owlbear nest whilst exploring - factoring in features and traits that could make this more or less likely)
