#### Character Generation
- When creating a new character, Arctos will create a channel, role, and nickname for you
- For DMs, this extends to generating NPCs and their channels (but not roles or nicknames)

- Arctos will (hopefully!) provide players with a filled form fillable .pdf of their character
#### Combat
- Arctos will help guide newer players through the steps they can take, as well as having the functionality to roll for attacks
- Arctos can help DMs by tracking enemy (and party) hitpoints
- To assist with immersion, Arctos has an optional "threat tracker" to help determine which PC enemies will target at any given moment
#### Items
- Arctos will be able to generate inventories for merchants
- Arctos will be able to generate magical items
